# 2. IDE and Code Asistant
## IDE
As an IDE I chose Visual Studio Code because it is the IDE I normally use. I find it very versatile (it supports almost any programming language) and it's features are extensible using extensions, which makes it even better. Also, keyboard shortcuts make it great in terms of productivity.

## Code Asistant
For the code asistant I chose Amazon Q. I did some reaserch about free code asistant's for VS code and the one that I found most people recomend was Amazon Q. Hence, I decided to give it a shot.

### Was Amazon Q helpfull or not?
